# land_rover
a mobile controlled land rover with the help pf HC-05 bluetooth module and arduino uno. All the codes and image and videos are dumped(Forgive the quality of the image and video).
Any third party mobile app can be used to control the car, but be sure what character is recieved by the arduino when a specific button is pressed on the app through the bluetooth module and code accordingly.
